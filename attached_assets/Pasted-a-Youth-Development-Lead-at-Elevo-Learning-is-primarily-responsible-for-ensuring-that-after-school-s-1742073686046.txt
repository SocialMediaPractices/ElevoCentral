a Youth Development Lead at Elevo Learning is primarily responsible for ensuring that after‐school sports and youth enrichment programs run smoothly and safely. Key functions include:



Operational Oversight



• Staff Supervision & Training: Oversee on-site staff—including coaches, referees, and program leaders—to ensure they’re well prepared and consistently implementing Elevo’s curriculum and behavior management strategies.

• Safety & Compliance: Implement and monitor safety plans, follow emergency procedures, and ensure all student records (e.g., sign-in/sign-out rosters) are maintained according to Elevo and district guidelines.

• Program Coordination: Collaborate with regional management and school administrators to align program activities (enrichment, snack/meal distribution, homework help, and physical education/SEL activities) with site-level objectives.



Communication & Reporting



• Point-of-Contact Role: Act as the main on-site liaison for parents, school staff, and district representatives, addressing any concerns and ensuring smooth communication between Elevo and school partners.

• Daily Reporting & Inventory: Complete incident and end-of-day reports for leadership review, keep track of on-site supplies, and manage inventory/logistics to support program delivery.



Leadership & Engagement



• Role Modeling: Serve as a positive, inspiring presence for both students and staff, fostering a culture of engagement and continuous improvement.

• Meeting Participation: Regularly attend Youth Development Lead meetings (in-person or virtually) and additional training sessions to stay updated on best practices and new initiatives.



This role is pivotal not only for day-to-day operational excellence but also for creating an environment where students thrive both academically and socially. From a venture capitalist’s perspective, ensuring that such a leadership position is executed effectively is critical to scaling a program that is both impactful and replicable. It’s essential to invest in standardized training and robust operational frameworks so that each site maintains consistent quality—a factor that can significantly enhance Elevo Learning’s long-term value and social impact.
