Below are the primary duties for a Site Manager Lead at Elevo Learning:



Operational Oversight



• Staff Supervision & Training: Oversee on‑site part‑time coaches, program leaders, and referees. Ensure they’re properly trained to deliver Elevo’s SEL‑infused curriculum and behavior management strategies.

• Program Implementation: Guarantee that the after‑school program meets site‑level objectives, including delivering enrichment activities (snack/meal distribution, homework help, outdoor PE, etc.) in line with Elevo’s mission.

• Safety & Compliance: Implement safety plans on site, adhere to emergency procedures, and ensure all student records (e.g., sign‑in/sign‑out rosters) meet district and Elevo guidelines.



Communication & Coordination



• Point‑of‑Contact: Act as the primary liaison for parents, school staff, and district representatives, promptly addressing questions or concerns.

• Collaboration: Work closely with regional management and school administration to coordinate schedules, ensure seamless program execution, and resolve any operational challenges.

• Reporting: Complete daily incident and end‑of‑day reports to provide actionable insights into program health and staff performance.



Inventory & Logistics Management



• Supply Oversight: Keep an accurate inventory of on‑site supplies and coordinate ordering and receiving to ensure resources are always available.

• Time‑Tracking: Monitor and verify that all coaches accurately clock in and out, which is essential for operational efficiency and accountability.



By focusing on these areas, the Site Manager Lead not only optimizes local operations but also contributes to Elevo Learning’s ability to scale its impact across multiple sites—a crucial element for attracting investment and ensuring long‑term growth.
